Description: 
        WConio2.py
        ----------
        
        This module is a pure Python reimplementation of my WConio module, and is
        generally API compatible with version 1.5.1 of that module.  WConio provides a
        color console interface for Windows applications using an interface based
        generally on the conio.h functions included with Turbo C 2.0.  While the
        original module depended on code written by Daniel Guerrero Miralles, this
        module includes none of his code.
        
        The conio.h functions don't map perfectly to Python, so I have taken some
        liberties.  In particular, the window() functionality is not provided, and
        screen coordinates are based at 0, 0 (logical for Python, but counter to the
        tradition of conio.h).
        
        If you are porting an application written for the original WConio, it's
        perfectly acceptable to say:
        
        import WConio2 as WConio
